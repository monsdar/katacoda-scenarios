Before we're diving into Conan let's make ourselves familiar with the environment we're working in.

There is a very simple `main.cpp` that gets built with a standard `CMakeLists.txt`. To open those files click onto the following links:
* `helloworld/source/main.cpp`{{open}}
* `helloworld/source/CMakeLists.txt`{{open}}

As you can see there is no magic going on... Building the app is straight-forward:
* `cd helloworld/build`{{execute}}
* `cmake ../source`{{execute}}
* `cmake --build .`{{execute}}
* `./hello`{{execute}}
